☕ Project Henrietta
Project Henrietta was developed as part of a technical challenge for Popmenu. The mission was to design and build a high-conversion, sales-focused website for a boutique coffee shop.

🎯 The Vision
The goal was to create a digital experience for Henrietta’s Cafe that feels modern, refreshing, and inviting. To achieve this, I focused on:

Custom Visual Identity: I extracted a unique color palette designed to evoke warmth and freshness.

Modern Typography: Selected sleek, tech-forward typefaces to balance the "cozy cafe" vibe with a cutting-edge digital feel.

Popmenu Standards: The project strictly follows the "pm-" class naming convention and architectural systems used by Popmenu, ensuring clean, scalable, and professional code.

🛠️ Key Features
Sales-Oriented Design: Optimized layouts to drive customer engagement and orders.

Responsive UI: A seamless experience across all devices.

Brand Alignment: Every element was crafted to reflect the sophisticated yet welcoming atmosphere of Henrietta's.
